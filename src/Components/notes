STEP 29:

Tracks Array [{Song, Artist, Album}{Song, Artist, Album}...]

SearchResult parameter this.props.Array.Song exe

STEP 36:
Create state that receives songs added in object
Pass the state to a Playlist component like an atributte
this.props.playlist in the tracklist component
playlist in the tracklist 

STEP 40:
addTrack method creates an event handler 
listining for "OnClick". Use an if else statement 
with strings "-" and "+". 
 Use Array.push to add TRACK 
into playlist Array. Pass addTrack method to "TrackComponent".
 
STEP 48
Create method that chek's if minus sign is true or false. 
If minus sign is true .shift this.props.track from 
this.props.playlist. Set state to a variable with the
changes. 

STEP 56
Create "input" element in playlist.js that receives value and a method that 
inheretes functionality. 
In app.js create a method that change SetState to this.props.value 
Maybe use a variable that is equal to this.props.value and pass the 
variable as the new state.  

STEP 62
In app.js POST API to spotify. Work with an State array and SetState 
of playlist track array to empty using a method and passing it trow the playlist BUTTTON right after save. Create an event handler on playlist that passes 
this.props.playlist.array back to app.js

STEP 66
Create method within the app.js file. This method change state of the 
search results state whith SetState and a variable that contains an array
of objects with the search result from the value passed in SearchResults.js. Also, in SearchResults.js file work with an input 
that has a method that targets input value and pass it the app.js method. 
It is posible that if we are going to be working with an array to use the .find method 
with a function that relates the target value to the title of the song. Also we need to GET from spotify their array of objects. 

STEP 74
Use GET and POST functionalities. Create an Spotiy component and import this component (or array, or object...) into the App.js.
In app.js I will link the API into my states using the json lenguage.
